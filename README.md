# Perennial Utilities
### About
Perennial Utilities (or PUtils) is a b1.7.3 plugin that aims to add some QoL features to slightly improve the experience of playing on servers with putils.\
The plugin is still yet to release, I want to add some more things first.
I´ll update this as I go, so you all can see what will be in the plugin :)
